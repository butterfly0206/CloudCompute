  description: >
    CloudOS Compute API for batch style workloads in Autodesk. Developers can
    register compute worker types by following the cloudOS2.0 onboarding
    process. Users can submit jobs against registered worker types. The system
    treats input and output as opaque JSON payloads that must confirm to the
    JSON schema specified by the worker documentation outside this system. All
    APIs are used with the /api/v1 prefix.

      operationId: createJob
      description: >
        Creates a job for a particular compute worker type. Jobs can be seen as nearly immutable
        from the client point of view. Once the job is created, only its tags can be modified.
        A job will go through its own state machine and succeed or fail for various
        reasons including a worker-specific (defaults to 1 hour) or a worker
        no-longer heartbeating its progress (by default, required every 2
        minutes). All jobs will be deleted from the system after 30 days of
        lifetime. Input payload for the job must comply with the JSON
        specification provided by the job worker developer.
